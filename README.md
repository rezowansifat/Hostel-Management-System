# Hostel-Management-System

INTRODUCTION  : “HOSTEL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM” is a software developed for managing various activities in the hostel. For the past few years the number of educational institutions is increasing rapidly. Thereby the number of hostels is also increasing for the accommodation of the students studying in this institution. And hence there is a lot of strain on the persons who are running the hostel and software’s are not usually used in this context. This particular project deals with the problems of managing a hostel and avoids the problems which occur when carried manually. We can improve the efficiency of the system, thus overcoming the drawbacks of the existing manual system.
